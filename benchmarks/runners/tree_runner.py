"""Benchmark runner for the Swedish decision-tree classifier.

Supports two modes:

* ``auto`` — answers questions automatically from visual traits; stops
  at the first question it cannot resolve.
* ``oracle`` — feeds pre-recorded ground-truth answers from
  ``oracle_answers.json`` so the tree is evaluated under ideal
  conditions.
